# ♻️ Waste Classification App
This Streamlit web app uses a fine-tuned **MobileNetV2** model to classify images of waste into 6 categories:
- Cardboard
- Glass
- Metal
- Paper
- Plastic
- Trash

The goal is to help users identify recyclable materials easily from an uploaded photo.

##  How it works
- Upload an image of waste (e.g., plastic bottle, piece of metal, etc.)
- The model returns the predicted category and confidence score
- Built using **TensorFlow**, **Streamlit**, and **MobileNetV2**
